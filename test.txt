Hello Robert .Hope your fine.
Robert I have updated all the files of phonetracker.net on SVN repository on server.I think everything is done fine.And i had issues with Git , i tried alot to do it with TortiseGit , but the key that was generated by it was not working with Git, Thanks for access to your account.Actually I had to generate a key from my Git client app and put it in WinWinHost account at GitHUb
